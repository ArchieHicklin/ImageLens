### Developing the EdulensApp

First, make sure meteor is installed:

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

When this is done, you can simply download this repository, navigate to the directory and run:

`meteor`

Note that while simply cloning this repository will work, iOS and Android versions will have to be installed using the build command in [Meteor] (https://guide.meteor.com/mobile.html)
